Do you see the production queue ? Take your mouse and hover over the needed products.
Let's plant the needed fruits and vegetables to deliver the asked products. 
Go and PlantIt!

```
1. You already know what to produce! Now, grab some seeds!
2. Go to the field and plant them!
3. When they are ready you can take the fruits / vegetables and  either 
   cook them on the stove or combine them in the mixer.
4. At the end you need to deliver your product to the conveyor to get your points.
